# ESO Helm chart can only be installed once per K8s cluster, which caused
# failures when pipelines are built simultaneously. Given this, we need to
# install the ESO Helm chart to a single namespace, and reach a consensus before
# uninstalling it.
#
# The mechanism to determine consensus are unique labels on the ESO namespace,
# formatted 'conjur.org/$UNIQUE_TEST_ID'. Each pipeline will add its own unique
# label set to the timestamp of label creation, and set it to 'DONE' once it
# consents to uninstalling.
#
# If the ESO namespace has labels which indicate it is still in use, the
# timestamp value will be compared to the current time. If the label was applied
# more than a day ago, it is considered expired, it will be ignored for the
# purpose of consensus.
#
# Each pipeline will check for consensus once they've finished using ESO - the
# first to discover consensus will uninstall the ESO Helm chart and delete the
# namespace.
